# Shortest Path Finder using BFS Algortithm
This is a Python program that uses Pygame to visualize the process of finding the shortest path from a starting point to a target in a 2D grid. The program implements the BFS algorithm, a popular search algorithm used in pathfinding and graph traversal.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you will need Python 3.x and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```
Once you have Pygame installed, you can run the program by running the main.py script:

```
python pathfinder2.py
```
## Usage

### To use the program, follow these steps:

- Click on the grid cells to create a Start Point
- Press and hold to create Obstacles
- Click on the grid cells to create an End Point
- Press the Space key to start the pathfinding algorithm.
- Watch as the algorithm finds the shortest path to the target.
